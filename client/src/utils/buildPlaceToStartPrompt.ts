**Input Analysis:**
1. **Prospect Page Review:**
Analyze the "Notion prospect page" provided, paying close attention to the **Industry, Competition, Revenue, Discovery Call Notes, Pain Points, Recordings, and Client Provided Inputs (e.g., annual report)**. Identify key client challenges, strategic goals, and any specific requirements or constraints. 
 **Pursuit Summary Interpretation:**
Thoroughly understand the "Pursuit Summary" provided. Extract the core client objective, the proposed solution type, and any critical timelines or specific deliverables mentioned. For example, identify if the client is looking for "website redesign," "strategy development," "digital transformation," etc.

2. **Trusted Artifacts Database Analysis:**
Access and analyze the "trusted artifacts" database (a linked Notion database).
This database includes:
* **Vetted and selected proposals** across various engagement types - source for POC: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VrJZloAjJhqOpFwdYnsh8wFbaSWMXLTdbSghNDHwElQ/edit?slide=id.g36bcb64b776_0_202#slide=id.g36bcb64b776_0_202
 
* **Case studies.** source for POC: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VrJZloAjJhqOpFwdYnsh8wFbaSWMXLTdbSghNDHwElQ/edit?slide=id.g36bcb64b776_0_202#slide=id.g36bcb64b776_0_202

* **Project Closure Summary and Learnings:** This database captures project closure information, including lessons learned from completed projects across client name, engagement type, and actual results in Budget/Scope/Timeline/Casting. Source for POC: https://www.notion.so/Learnings-226abf201de68066b042da55f3e5515f?source=copy_link

**Crucially, evaluate how past BD estimates compared to actuals for timeline, budget, scope, and casting for similar engagement types.**

* **Suggested SOW Assumptions for Consideration:** Review these assumptions, which are mapped to engagement types, to identify relevant boilerplate or specific considerations. Source for POC: https://www.notion.so/SOW-Assumptions-226abf201de680ffa2afe4a4e68b4902?source=copy_link


* **Learnings from Engagement Type (Timeline, Budget, Scope, Casting):** Extract general learnings related to these project dimensions for the identified engagement type.

**Output Generation -
"Place to Start":** Generate an output following this structure.

Hey Kane, Sounds great!
Based on the client's needs, it looks like we're looking at a **[Engagement Type derived from Pursuit Summary/Prospect Page]** opportunity focused on **[Briefly summarize core client objective from Pursuit Summary]**.
Hereâ€™s a place to start: --- ###
**Look at these reference proposals:**
* **[Highly Relevant Proposal Title 1]** ([Link to Google Slide])
* **[Highly Relevant Proposal Title 2]** ([Link to Google Slide])
* **[Highly Relevant Proposal Title 3]** ([Link to Google Slide])

**Selection Criteria:** Prioritize proposals from the "trusted artifacts" database that most closely match the client's **industry, pain points, and the engagement type (e.g., website redesign, strategy, etc.) identified in the Pursuit Summary.** Aim for proposals that represent "best practices" for similar scopes or solutions. ---
### **And reference these similar project closures for learnings to apply:**
* **[Relevant Project Closure Summary 1 - with brief key takeaway]** ([Link to Notion Summary])
* **[Relevant Project Closure Summary 2 - with brief key takeaway]** ([Link to Notion Summary])

**Selection Criteria:** Choose project closures from the "trusted artifacts" database that demonstrate successful execution and provide valuable learnings in similar industries or for comparable client challenges and engagement types.
**Specifically, highlight any notable insights regarding initial BD estimates vs. actuals for budget, scope, timeline, or casting that might be relevant to this opportunity.** ---
### **These case studies also fit your opportunity - consider bringing these to the pitch:**
* **[Relevant Case Study Title 1]**
* **[Relevant Case Study Title 2]**

**Selection Criteria:** Select case studies from the "trusted artifacts" database that align with the client's industry, the specific problem they are trying to solve, or the type of impact they seek. ---

**Suggested SOW Assumptions & Project Learnings for Consideration:** **Based on the identified engagement type, consider incorporating the following into your SOW and planning:** * **Timeline Considerations:** [Synthesize learnings related to typical timelines for this engagement type, including common pitfalls or accelerators identified in project closures.] * **Budget Considerations:** [Synthesize learnings related to typical budget ranges, common scope creep factors, or efficient resource allocation for this engagement type.] * **Scope Definition Learnings:** [Synthesize learnings on how to best define scope to avoid issues, including common dependencies or client responsibilities that should be highlighted.] * **Casting/Team Learnings:** [Synthesize learnings about ideal team composition or specific roles that are critical for success in this engagement type.] * **Specific SOW Assumptions:** [List 2-3 specific, relevant SOW assumptions from the "trusted artifacts" database mapped to this engagement type. E.g., "Client to provide all content assets by X date," "Weekly stakeholder review meetings required," etc.]
